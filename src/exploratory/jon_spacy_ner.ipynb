They are great at identifying dates and times, but address names are consistently misclassified as persons, random groupings of words such as \"recover g\" and \"fl oor\" are labeled as persons, etc. Identifying \"LOC\" (locations) is difficult for these models. Because of this I was able to create a list of labeled persons and locations, based off the data gathered by the non-profit [Invisible Institute](https://github.com/invinst). I will cross-reference the correct labels with the models and try to fine-tune based of these results."
